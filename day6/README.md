## What is a Terraform Workspace?

A **workspace** in Terraform is a mechanism for managing multiple instances of the same Terraform configuration within the same backend. Each workspace has its own state file, allowing you to separate and organize environments (such as development, staging, and production) without needing separate directories or configurations.

## Why Do We Need Terraform Workspaces?

1. **Environment Separation**: Workspaces allow you to keep separate state files for different environments, helping you avoid unintended changes across environments and simplifying multi-environment management.
2. **Efficient Configuration Management**: With workspaces, you can reuse a single set of configuration files without duplicating code for each environment. This reduces redundancy and eases infrastructure management.
3. **Resource Isolation**: Each workspace maintains its own resources and state. Resources in one workspace wonâ€™t interfere with those in another.

## How to Use Terraform Workspaces

### Initialize the Workspace

Before using workspaces, initialize Terraform in your project:
### for know about terrafrom workspace 
```
terraform workspace -h 
```
```bash
terraform init
```
### Create a New Workspace
```
terraform workspace new <workspace_name>
```
### List Workspaces
```
terraform workspace list

```
### Switch Between Workspaces
```
terraform workspace select <workspace_name>

```
### Delete a Workspace
```
terraform workspace select default
terraform workspace delete <workspace_name>
```

### we can use in 3 different way or type, it in my notes please look into it
